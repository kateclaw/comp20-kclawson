Correctly implemented:

- Each Red Line station is marked with the same marker.
- A red line connects each station, branching where needed.
- The map centers on South Station on loading, then recenters to user's current location.
- User's current location is marked with a different Marker.
- When a user clicks on their location marker, they are told the nearest Red Line station, and a line is drawn there.
- When a user clicks on any station, the schedule for upcoming trains is reported.

Collaborators:

- I got some debugging and supportive help from my brother, Jackson.

Approximate time spent:

- 5 hours.
