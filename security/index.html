    <h1>Assignment 4: Security and Privacy Assessment of Assignment 3</h1>
    <h2>Kate Clawson</h2>
    <h3>Introduction</h3>
    <p>
      The product is a 2048 Game Center, in which a list of the top 10 scores
      from the game is printed to a web page, along with the associated username
      and time at which the game was completed. I was hired to find security
      vulnerabilities in Meha Elhence's work, through both black box testing and
      looking at the source code.
    </p>
    <h3>Methodology</h3>
    <p>
      I first tried the tactics outlined by Ming in class using a black box
      approach. So, I first played with XSS and tried to insert a username that
      was really just javascript using curl. However, this just put
      "scriptalertscript" as a username into the database, meaning they
      accounted for XSS attacks. (when I later looked at the source code, I
      confirmed this was true). I then tried an injection attack by querying a
      username that I knew was not stored in the database using the [$ne]
      operator. However, this gave me an "internal server error". Curious, I
      tried just going to the /scores.json route without any query strings, and
      found a server error here, as well. After trying these two tactics, I
      scanned the source code for any clear security vulernabilities, and found
      a vulnerability in the MongoDB URI. However, because my partner's app
      wasn't fully functional, I ended up doing a lot of research on web app
      security, and tried to find attack tactics and security measures that may
      apply to the 2048 Game Center and my partner's code. I read about CORS,
      (D)DoS attacks, and the built in security of Heroku apps. The following 3
      issues are what I could conclude from what we learned in class and the
      research I did.
    </p>
    <h3>Abstract of Findings</h3>
    <p>
      This 2048 Game Center app was volunerable to a few security attacks. If
      one wanted to, they could alter the URL of the application to retrieve
      whatever information they wanted to from the database. Additionally,
      because the developer didn't specify exactly who could have access to the
      site, anyone, with mal intentions or not, would have access to it and
      therefore be able to manipulate in whatever way they wanted. Finally, the
      app is succeptible to attacks in which hackers severely and detrementally
      overwhelm a server with a lot of input.
    </p>
    <h3>Issues Found</h3>
    <h4>Issue 1: Vulnerable to Injections</h4>
    <p>
      In the url of the app, I queried: "...scores.json?username[$ne]=kate" to
      see all usernames "not equal" to "kate". This should ideally display all
      usernames in the database that are not "kate". However, as I mentioned in
      "Methodlogy", I was unable to truly test this, as I received a server
      error when I tried to reach the /scores.json route.
    </p>

    <p>
      Although I was unable to actually test whether or not I could retrieve all
      usernames in the database, upon looking at the source code, there is
      nothing that suggests any precautions taken to try to combat this. I
      presume that if the code functioned properly, I would have succesfully
      retrieved this data and found a high security vulnerability.
    </p>
    <h4>Issue 2: MongoDB URI Hardcoded</h4>
    <p>
      When the author of this code declared their "MongoUri" variable to store
      their connection to their MongoDB database, they included their database
      address provided by mLab, as shown in the image below (in server.js).
    </p>
    <img src="mongo.png" alt="MongoDB URI" />
    <p>
      This address requires that the developer include their username and
      password. So, by including the database in this manner, the developer
      effectively shared their username and password to the database to whoever
      has access to the source code of the application. This would be a high
      security vulnerability, particularly if the information in the database
      was of high privacy.
    </p>

    <h4>Issue 3: CORS Universally Accessible</h4>
    <p>
      While it was required that each 2048 Game Center allow CORS, careless
      usage can lead to security vulnerabilities. The author of this code
      allowed sharing with any origin, as denoted by the "*" (in server.js, in
      the get "/" route, pictured below).
    </p>
    <img src="CORS.png" alt="screenshot of CORS specifications" />
    <p>
      This means that any site can make a request to the author's app on behalf
      of their visitors and process its response. In general, if the developer
      has an implementaion like authentication or authorization that is based on
      what is automatically provided by the browser (like cookies), the requests
      triggered by the third party sites will use them too. In order to decrease
      this risk, it is suggested that the developer associate a list of domains
      that are allowed access to the app. While this is not of utmost importance
      for this project, if the app stored more private, important information,
      it would be essential that the author limit who has access to the site,
      while also keeping it accessible to those who need it.
    </p>
    <h4>Issue 4: DDoS Protection</h4>
    <p>
      While DDoS isn't something that was of great concern for this project and
      might not be for a 2048 Game Center generally, this is a security issue
      that concerns many larger sites with more traffic and sensitive
      information. DDoS, a Distributed Denial of Service attack, occurs when
      multiple systems flood the resources of a server, essentially overwhelming
      the servers with traffic to the point at which the host can not discern
      between what is legitimate or illegitimate information. Heroku has some
      measures in place to combat DDoS attacks, but there are additional
      measures that can be taken to protect against these kinds of attacks, if
      they are of concern.
    </p>
    <h3>Conclusion</h3>
    <p>
      While difficult to test for specific, tangible sercurity vulnerabilities
      in this code, particularly the ones demonstrated in class, like XSS and
      Injection attacks, due to limited app functionality, I was able to find
      some general security precautions that developers should take when
      creating a web app, as well as a vulnerability in the MongoDB URI
      declaration. Primarly, it is essential that developers do not trust user
      input! If a user is able to input whatever information they desire into a
      web application, they can easily retrieve and exploit private and
      potentially sensitive information. In web apps that require more security
      precautions, for example and app that has an authentication element to it,
      like storing usernames and passwords, it is important that more serious
      consideration is taken regarding security vulnerabilities. A developer
      would want to protect against brute-force password attacks, as well as any
      attack that would allow someone to access any information stored on the
      server or in a database associated with the site. Another aspect to
      consider is how long the user has been signed in to an app or has stayed
      on any given window - if there is a certain amount of inactivity, it would
      be important for the developer to have some kind of measure to ensure that
      the user is still using the site and wants to remain signed in. If the
      session "times out" at a certain amount of time, it will decrease the
      likelihood that an attacker could access sensitive information after a
      user has been using a site.
