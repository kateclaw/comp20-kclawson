Purpose:

- This Git repository holds all of my assignments from the Comp 20: Web Programming class. These assignments cover topics including responsive images, html video captions, an interactive, personalized map of the mbta, and adapting the 2048 game to store a series of data inputs.

Favorite lab or assignment:

- I liked the MBTA assignment. Although difficult, I had a lot of fun trying to figure out how to use the Google Maps API and how to structure my code in the most efficient way I could.

Growth:

- I came into the class with a bit of background knowledge on the subject, but through this class I've become a lot more comfortable with web development as a whole. I understand the concepts in more depth and know why I take certain steps when I do them, instead of just doing them because someone told me to.

Must important thing:

- The web is an incredibly powerful tool that everyone graduating with any kind of knowledge in computer science should be trained on.
  - The internet powers just about everything around us, and if we aren't careful, our data can be easily shared/stolen in unexpected and unforunate ways. This was shown in class numerous times when talking about security - don't trust user input!!
  - This was also shown in the conversation Ming had with a recruiter, discussing how many students coming out of college don't have knowledge about how the web works, or how to keep it secure.

Topic I'd like to explore further:

- I love design and translating designs into tangible products has been really fun for me, so I think I'd like to continue explore this to some extent.
- I also think security would be an interesting topic to study further, as I haven't had much exposure to it but it seems very interesting and is clearly very important.
